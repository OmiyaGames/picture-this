# Temp Title #

## Objective:

2 or more players must draw an artwork only one of the player, the leader, knows. The leader, however, can only use body gestures to communicate to the other players how to draw the target artwork.

## Requirements:

* 2 or more players
* Pen and paper / computer and mouse / anything to draw

## How to Play:

1. Designate one player as the leader.  This player needs to stand up, and face the other players.
2. The leader must pick-up a random card from the diagram-deck.
	1. This card cannot be revealed to the other players.
	2. The leader must hold onto the diagram until the end of the drawing session.
	3. So long as the card remains hidden, the leader may check it for reference at any time during the drawing session.
3. The other players prepares a piece of paper, and places their pen’s tip at the center of the paper.
4. The leader must inform the rest of the players that the art they need to draw can be drawn without lifting their pen from the paper.
5. When ready, the leader uses the body gesture language described under "Gestures" to instruct the other players what to draw.
	1. With exactly one exception (described below), the leader may not speak while instructing the rest of the players.
	2. The other players may ask the leader any yes-or-no questions.  The leader may respond by nodding or shaking their head.
6. The leader can say either "close" or "finish" to end the drawing session if the following conditions are met:
	1. If the diagram is a closed shape, the leader can say, "close" to indicate the player that they can connect their current position on the paper to the very first point they’ve made (the center of the paper), effectively closing the shape and ending the drawing session.
	2. If the diagram is not a closed shape, the leader can say, "finish" whenever they deem the drawn artwork is close enough to the target diagram.
7. The leader finally reveals the card to the other players.

## Gestures:

### Direction Gesture:

A leader provides a direction to draw by simply pointing to a direction perpendicular to the direction they’re facing.  This gesture is meant to be used with the other gestures listed below to create a sentence.  For brevity, the rest of the document will refer to this gesture as, "Direction Gesture."

#### Examples:

* Pointing up stands for, "draw up"
* Pointing right relative to the other players stands for, "draw right"
* Pointing down-left relative to the other players stands for, "draw down-left"

### Straight Line Gesture:

When the leader moves their arms up-and-down twice, followed by a Direction Gesture, this indicates to the other players to draw a straight line from their pen’s current position.

#### Examples:

When the leader

1. moves their arms up-and-down twice,
2. then points up,
3. that stands for, "draw a straight line upwards."

### Curved Line Gesture:

When the leader moves their arms into an L-formation, then to a mirrored L-formation, and back twice, this indicates to the other players to start drawing a curved line from their pen’s current position.  This gesture is followed by a Direction Gesture, then crossing the arms into an X, and finally a second Direction Gesture to indicate the starting direction of the curve, followed by an ending direction.

#### Examples:

When the leader

1. moves their arms into an L, then mirrored, then back twice,
2. then points up,
3. crosses their arm into an X,
4. then points right,
5. that stands for, "draw a curved line that starts going upwards, then gradually curves to the right."

### Keep Going Gesture:

If the leader needs to indicate to the other players that they need to continue drawing the line they’ve created, the leader can squat up and down to indicate to the rest of the players to keep going.  This gesture can be combined with a Direction Gesture.

#### Examples:

When the other players

1. stops drawing a straight line to the right,
2. but the leader is squatting up-and-down (possibly while still pointing to the right),
3. that stands for, "keep drawing that straight line to the right.

### Stop Gesture:

When the leader claps, that indicates to the other players that they should stop moving their pen.

#### Examples:

When the other players

1. keeps drawing a straight line to the right,
2. and the leader claps,
3. that stands for, "stop drawing the straight line in that direction."

### More Gesture:

If the leader needs to indicate to the other players that the angle of their curved line needs modification,  the leader can use two arms to point to the direction the other players needs to curve their line more strongly.

#### Examples:

When the other players

1. draws a curve going from right to down, but needs to be curved more downwards,
2. and the leader points both their arms down,
3. that stands for, "curve the line more downwards."
